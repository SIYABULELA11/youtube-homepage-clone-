Hi There.
This is a YouTube homepage clone program. This was made to basically implement html and css skills.
You can download the zip file consting of all the related files for this program and you can run in your IDE.
Please node after downloading the zip file all related files should be  moved howerever you can move the folder. Just dont separate the files.
to run this you can just open the html file in an ide then it will redirect you to a web browser where youll see the output of this wonderful clone.
When you click to thumbnails or channel profiles you'll be redirected to the real youtube video/ YouTube profile.
Thank you. Enjoy!
